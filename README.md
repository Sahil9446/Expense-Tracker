# Expense-Tracker
Made it with Tkinter,
It is a user-friendly windows application made,
where you can add your expense and a pie chart will be shown of what are the things you spent your money on,
it is a basic application for better understanding of Python Language with simple use,
while working on the main window, and will upload it later on here.

                                        Here's The simple/basic Sign In window:
